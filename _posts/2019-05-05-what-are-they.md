 ## What is the fidget spinner?

 The fidget spinner is a small device that fits in your hand. It is usually made up of two parts – a central bearing that you grip with your index finger and thumb, and a three-pronged rotational blade (resembling a rounded Chinese throwing star) that spins around it once you give it a flick with your free hand. There are some wackier designs that eschew this template (such as the multi-bladed cog version), but they generally stick to the same blueprint.

 ## Why is it so addictive?

While other crazes have relied on collectability or competition, the fidget-spinner craze has taken off due to the toy’s immediately addictive nature. The sensation that comes from holding a fast-spinning contraption is a large part of its appeal. As you tilt it back and forth while it whirrs, you can feel the various spinning forces undulate in your hand.
